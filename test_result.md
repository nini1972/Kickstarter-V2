        comment: "MongoDB Atlas configuration is properly implemented. The database connection is established in the lifespan function with proper error handling. The connection string is retrieved from environment variables, and the database name is dynamically determined. The health check endpoint correctly reports database status, including connection state, response time, and metadata."

        comment: "Security middleware is comprehensively implemented with protection against NoSQL injection, XSS, and path traversal. The middleware validates and sanitizes headers, query parameters, and request bodies. It includes pattern matching for dangerous MongoDB operators and keywords. HTML content is sanitized using bleach. The middleware is properly integrated into the FastAPI application."

        comment: "Prometheus metrics endpoint is properly implemented at /api/metrics with comprehensive system metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage), application metrics (requests, auth failures, security violations), and service health metrics. The detailed metrics endpoint at /api/admin/metrics provides additional information for monitoring dashboards. The monitoring service includes comprehensive health checks for all services."

        comment: "Docker setup is properly implemented with multi-stage builds for frontend and backend. The final image is based on nginx:stable-alpine for a small footprint. The configuration includes proper environment variable handling and security considerations. The entrypoint script properly starts both the backend and nginx with health checks and signal handling."

        comment: "Deployment automation is properly implemented in the entrypoint script. The script includes proper error handling, health checks, and graceful shutdown. It waits for the backend to start before starting nginx and monitors both processes. The script handles termination signals properly to ensure clean shutdown."
