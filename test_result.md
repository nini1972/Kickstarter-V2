# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## frontend:

##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

## backend:
  - task: "MongoDB Atlas Configuration"
    implemented: true

    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "MongoDB Atlas configuration is properly implemented. The database connection is established in the lifespan function with proper error handling. The connection string is retrieved from environment variables, and the database name is dynamically determined. The health check endpoint correctly reports database status, including connection state, response time, and metadata."

  - task: "Production Security Hardening"
    implemented: true
    working: true

    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Security middleware is comprehensively implemented with protection against NoSQL injection, XSS, and path traversal. The middleware validates and sanitizes headers, query parameters, and request bodies. It includes pattern matching for dangerous MongoDB operators and keywords. HTML content is sanitized using bleach. The middleware is properly integrated into the FastAPI application."

  - task: "Monitoring & Observability"

    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Prometheus metrics endpoint is properly implemented at /api/metrics with comprehensive system metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage), application metrics (requests, auth failures, security violations), and service health metrics. The detailed metrics endpoint at /api/admin/metrics provides additional information for monitoring dashboards. The monitoring service includes comprehensive health checks for all services."

    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Backup service is properly implemented with full and incremental backup capabilities. The service supports local file storage and S3 cloud backup. Backup metadata is stored in the database with retention policies. The service includes proper error handling and cleanup of old backups. The backup endpoints are secured with admin authentication."

  - task: "Docker Production Setup"

    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Docker setup is properly implemented with multi-stage builds for frontend and backend. The final image is based on nginx:stable-alpine for a small footprint. The configuration includes proper environment variable handling and security considerations. The entrypoint script properly starts both the backend and nginx with health checks and signal handling."

  - task: "Deployment Automation"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/entrypoint.sh"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Deployment automation is properly implemented in the entrypoint script. The script includes proper error handling, health checks, and graceful shutdown. It waits for the backend to start before starting nginx and monitors both processes. The script handles termination signals properly to ensure clean shutdown."

## frontend:
  - task: "Dashboard Interface"
    implemented: true
    working: false
